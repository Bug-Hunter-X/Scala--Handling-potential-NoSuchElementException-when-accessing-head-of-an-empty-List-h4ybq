This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala programming: using the `head` method on a list without checking for emptiness. The example shows how to create and use a mutable `ListBuffer` and then how to safely access the `head` element of the list, preventing the `NoSuchElementException`.  The `bug.scala` file contains the code demonstrating the error; `bugSolution.scala` provides the improved, exception-safe solution.
